# I2C-Buffer
A compact and reliable **PCA9515A-based I²C Buffer** board designed to extend and stabilize I²C communication between multiple devices or long cable runs.  
The board isolates two I²C buses (A and B sides), protecting each side from bus capacitance issues and signal degradation.  
It’s fully compatible with **3.3V and 5V logic levels**, making it ideal for mixed-voltage systems and long-distance I²C communication.
